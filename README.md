# Project Title: Password Strength Checker
![Alt text](https://github.com/fidhathasnin/CODTECH-Task1/blob/main/pwd.PNG)

## Description
The Password Strength Checker is a web-based tool designed to help users create strong and secure passwords. It evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria, including length, complexity, and uniqueness. The tool provides real-time feedback, guiding users to create passwords that are less susceptible to breaches.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Feedback**: The tool provides immediate feedback on password strength as the user types.
- **Length Analysis**: Checks if the password meets the minimum length requirement.
- **Complexity Evaluation**: Verifies the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Detects common patterns, sequences, and compares the password against a list of common passwords to ensure uniqueness.
- **Visual Indicators**: Uses color-coded text to indicate the strength level, ranging from weak to very strong.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the tool.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the password input field and strength feedback.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic for analyzing password strength and providing real-time feedback.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly tool that helps individuals create secure passwords by providing them with immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords. By implementing a range of algorithms, the tool aims to educate users on the importance of password complexity and uniqueness, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Conclusion
The Password Strength Checker successfully demonstrates the importance of password security by evaluating and educating users on creating strong passwords. This project not only serves as a practical tool for enhancing online security but also as a learning experience in web development, covering key concepts in frontend development and security practices.

By continuing to refine and expand this project, it has the potential to be integrated into broader security systems or used as an educational tool to promote better password practices.
